# Hello my name is Joan Sanchez

I am a Technical Engineer in Computer Science with 10 years of experience, I want to be a full-time developer so at the moment I am practicing every day Swift, Python, and C#.

I have already worked in some positions related to software development, but it has never been my main activity, so with this motive I am learning and working to improve my skills. At the moment I'm working on some personal projects and I intend to dedicate some time and other open-source projects to practice.

My native language is Spanish, but I am a B1 English student and every day I dedicate some minutes to do my best to learn more.

My main goal is to work as a full-time developer and keep working to be the best software developer as can be.


## Practice Roadmap

- Making my first IOS App (app to calculate food portions with a standard recipe)
        - Make the user interface using spline app.
        - Make the first alpha of the app, with the minimum requirements (divide the main recipe in the amount of portions).
        - Make an update to add more food if the user selects more people than the main recipe.

- Make a port for my IOS app to windows with python.

- Make my first video game in Unreal Engine 5 (Metal Gear VR Like for mobile)
