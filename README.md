# Hello! My name is Joan Sanchez

I am a Technical Engineer in Computer Science since 2014, I want to be a full time developer so at the moment I am practicing every day Swift, Python and C#. 

I have already worked in some positions related to software development, but it has never been my main activity, so for this motive I am learning and working to improve my skills. At the moment I'm working on some personal projects and my intention is to dedicate some time to other open source projects to practice.

My native language is Spanish, but I am a B1 English student and every day I dedicate some minutes to do my best to learn more.

My main goal is work as a full time developer, and keep working to be the best software developer as can be.


## Study Roadmap

- Making my first IOS App (app to calculate food portions with a standard recipe)
        - Make the user interface using spline app.
        - Make the first alpha of the app, with the minimum requirements (divide the main recipe in the amount of portions).
        - Make an update to add more food if the user selects more people than the main recipe.

- Make a port for my IOS app to windows with python.

- Make my first video game in Unreal Engine 5 (Metal Gear VR Like for mobile)
